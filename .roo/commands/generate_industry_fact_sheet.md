## Use Case 1: AI Scribe Reduces Documentation Time - Simple Implementation, Immediate Impact

**Company:** Mercy Health System, 40-hospital network based in Missouri

**Challenge:** Physicians were spending 2-3 hours daily on clinical documentation, contributing to burnout and reducing patient face time.

**Solution:** Mercy Health implemented Nuance DAX Copilot, an ambient AI clinical documentation tool that listens to patient conversations and automatically generates clinical notes. The off-the-shelf solution required minimal technical setup and integrated with their existing Epic EHR system.

**Implementation:** Rolled out to 850 physicians over 3 months starting August 2024, with 2-hour training sessions and ongoing support from Nuance implementation team.

**Results:**
* Reduced documentation time by 2.5 hours per physician per day
* Increased patient face time by 35%
* Improved physician satisfaction scores by 28%
* Achieved 92% physician adoption rate within first month
* Documented ROI of $3.2 million annually in recovered physician time

**Key Takeaway:** Pre-built AI solutions can deliver immediate, measurable impact without requiring technical expertise or custom development.

## Use Case 2: Automated Prior Authorization Streamlines Operations - Automation Driving Efficiency

**Company:** Cleveland Clinic, academic medical center with 6,500 beds

**Challenge:** Processing 180,000 prior authorization requests annually required 45 full-time staff members and averaged 3-5 days per request, delaying patient care.

**Solution:** Cleveland Clinic deployed Olive AI's prior authorization automation platform, which uses robotic process automation and machine learning to handle routine authorization requests. The system automatically extracts patient data, checks payer requirements, submits requests, and tracks status.

**Implementation:** Phased rollout over 6 months starting June 2024, beginning with highest-volume procedures and expanding to all departments by December 2024.

**Results:**
* Reduced average authorization processing time from 4.2 days to 6 hours
* Automated 68% of prior authorization requests end-to-end
* Decreased staff time spent on authorizations by 73%
* Improved authorization approval rate from 82% to 94%
* Saved approximately $2.8 million annually in administrative costs

**Key Takeaway:** Workflow automation can transform time-intensive administrative processes, freeing staff for higher-value work while improving outcomes.

## Use Case 3: Custom Sepsis Prediction Model Saves Lives - Custom Engineering for Competitive Advantage

**Company:** Johns Hopkins Hospital, 1,000-bed academic medical center in Baltimore

**Challenge:** Sepsis affects 1.7 million Americans annually with 30% mortality rate. Early detection is critical but difficult, with traditional screening missing 40% of cases.

**Solution:** Johns Hopkins developed a custom machine learning model integrated via API with their Epic EHR system. The model analyzes 65 patient data points in real-time (vital signs, lab results, medications) to predict sepsis risk 6-12 hours before clinical symptoms appear. The engineering team spent 18 months developing and validating the model with 50,000 patient records.

**Implementation:** Custom API integration with Epic EHR, real-time data pipeline, clinical workflow integration with nursing staff alerts, and ongoing model monitoring and refinement.

**Results:**
* Detected sepsis an average of 8.4 hours earlier than traditional screening
* Reduced sepsis mortality rate by 18% (from 28% to 23%)
* Decreased ICU length of stay for sepsis patients by 1.8 days
* Improved early antibiotic administration from 67% to 89% of cases
* Estimated 120 lives saved annually across the hospital system

**Key Takeaway:** Strategic investment in custom AI engineering can deliver breakthrough clinical outcomes that create lasting competitive advantages.
