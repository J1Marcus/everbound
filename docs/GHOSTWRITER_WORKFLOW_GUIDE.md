# Professional Ghostwriter Workflow: Complete Implementation Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Status:** Implementation Specification

## Document Purpose

This document transforms the memoir creation process from an open-ended "add text memory" approach into a structured, intelligent interview process that mimics how professional ghostwriters work. The system includes photo intelligence for both visual storytelling and AI-enhanced descriptions.

---

## Overview: The Transformation

### Replace Current Approach:
❌ Generic "Add Text Memory" button after voice calibration  
❌ Open-ended, unstructured memory capture  
❌ No guidance on what to write about  

### With Structured Ghostwriter Approach:
✅ Gentle profile questionnaire (10-15 checkbox questions)  
✅ Personalized section roadmap (9-12 chapters based on their life)  
✅ Scene-based prompts (specific, sensory-rich questions)  
✅ Tiered sensitivity (respects comfort boundaries)  
✅ Progressive unlocking (complete one section to unlock next)  
✅ Photo intelligence (dual purpose: illustration + AI enhancement)  
✅ Synthesis checkpoints (chapter previews with quality feedback)  
✅ Calm, guided experience (one prompt at a time, clear progress)

## Phase 1: First-Time Setup - "Build the Outline" (Not the Book)

### Step A: Gentle Profile (2 minutes, checkbox-first)

**Goal:** Avoid irrelevant questions without feeling clinical. Earn trust early.

#### Relationship & Family
- [ ] Married/partnered (now / previously / never)
- [ ] Children (yes/no)
- [ ] Siblings (yes/no)
- [ ] Parents (raised by parents / one parent / grandparents / other)

#### Life Structure
- [ ] Military service (yes/no)
- [ ] Major careers (one / multiple)
- [ ] Lived in multiple places (yes/no)
- [ ] Travel important to you (yes/no)
- [ ] Faith/spirituality important (yes/no)

#### Comfort Boundaries (builds trust)
- [ ] "I'm comfortable discussing romance" (yes/no)
- [ ] "I'm comfortable discussing loss/trauma" (yes/no)
- [ ] "Skip anything too personal" (yes/no)

**Why this matters:** Prevents awkward prompts and respects dignity.

---

### Step B: Life Timeline Anchors (Scaffolding, Not Stories)

Ask for anchors, not full stories yet:

1. Birth year (or approximate)
2. Where you grew up (city/state/country)
3. High school years range (optional)
4. First job age (optional)
5. Major moves (just the cities)
6. Partner: when you met (optional)
7. Kids: birth years (optional)
8. 5–10 "milestones" (bulleted; user can skip)

**Output:** Internal timeline to organize prompts chronologically.

---

### Step C: Choose "Book Type" Flavor (Tone, Not Feature)

- [ ] Reflective
- [ ] Warm
- [ ] Humorous
- [ ] Direct

**Framing:**
- "More like a letter to my family" vs "More like a life story"

**Purpose:** Drives voice calibration and prose generation style.

---

## Phase 2: Section Structure - The Memoir "Chapters" You're Collecting

### Core Sections (Almost Always Applicable)

1. **Origins** - Birth, family background, early home
2. **Childhood** - School, friends, routines, early joys/fears
3. **Teen Years** - Identity, rebellion, passions, formative moments
4. **Early Adulthood** - Leaving home, first independence, early work
5. **Work & Purpose** - Career arcs, proud moments, failures, lessons
6. **Values & Beliefs** - What mattered, what changed, why
7. **Hobbies & Joy** - Sports, music, books, travel, "things that made life feel alive"
8. **Milestones & Turning Points** - Moves, losses, wins, surprises
9. **Lessons & Legacy** - Advice, regrets, gratitude, what you hope they remember

### Conditional Sections (Toggle Based on Profile)

- **Love & Partnership** - Met partner, romance, marriage, hard seasons (if married/partnered)
- **Parenthood** - Naming kids, what surprised you, what you learned (if children)
- **Family Web** - Siblings, cousins, grandparents, family traditions (if siblings/extended family)
- **Service & Sacrifice** - Military, caregiving, major hardship (if military/trauma comfort)
- **Big Adventures** - Skydiving, concerts, travel stories, "first time I…" (if travel/adventure flagged)

**Key Principle:** You're offering a menu of meaningful lanes, not asking "tell me about everything."

---

## Phase 3: Prompt Design - Scene-Based, Not Topic-Based

### The Prompt Pack Template (Works Everywhere)

Ghostwriters don't ask broad questions. They ask scene prompts using this 5-part structure:

1. **Scene:** "Take me to a moment…" (sensory, specific)
2. **People:** "Who was there and what were they like?"
3. **Tension:** "What was hard/uncertain?"
4. **Change:** "How did it change you?"
5. **Meaning:** "Looking back, what do you wish you knew?"

This reliably produces book-grade material.

### Example Prompts by Section

#### Origins
- "Take me to the house you were born in or first remember. What did it smell like? What sounds do you remember?"
- "Who was there when you were very young? What were they like?"
- "What was hard about your early years?"

#### Childhood
- "Take me to your elementary school. What did the hallways smell like? What sounds do you remember?"
- "Who was your first best friend? What did you do together?"
- "What scared you as a child?"
- "What made you feel safe?"

#### Teen Years
- "Take me to a moment when you felt like you didn't fit in. Where were you?"
- "Who understood you when no one else did?"
- "What were you rebelling against?"
- "What passion or interest defined your teenage years?"

#### Love & Partnership (Tiered for sensitivity)
- **Tier 1 (safe):** "Who were your first close friends or early crushes?"
- **Tier 2 (optional):** "Do you remember your first kiss? (Skip if you prefer.)"
- **Tier 3 (private):** "How did you meet your partner? What was your first impression?"
- **Tier 4 (depth):** "Take me to the moment you knew they were 'the one.'"
- **Privacy option:** "Would you like this included in the book, or kept as private notes?"

#### Parenthood
- "Take me to the moment you found out you were going to be a parent. What went through your mind?"
- "Describe holding your first child. What did you feel?"
- "How did you choose your children's names? What's the story behind each one?"
- "What surprised you most about being a parent?"

#### Big Adventures
- "Have you ever done something adventurous like skydiving, bungee jumping, or scuba diving? Take me to that moment."
- "What concert or performance moved you? Why did it matter?"
- "Tell me about a place you traveled that changed how you see the world."

#### Work & Purpose
- "Take me to your first day at your most important job. What were you feeling?"
- "Who was a mentor who changed your career? What did they teach you?"
- "What's a professional failure that taught you something valuable?"

#### Lessons & Legacy
- "What book or piece of media influenced how you think about the world?"
- "What advice would you give your younger self?"
- "What do you hope people remember about you?"

## Phase 4: Photo Intelligence Integration

### Dual Purpose of Photos

Photos serve two critical functions:

1. **Visual Illustration** - Placed in the printed book for visual storytelling
2. **AI Corroboration** - Used to enhance and validate narrative descriptions

---

### Photo Upload Workflow

#### Option 1: Photo-First Memory Capture

User uploads photo → AI analyzes image → Generates contextual prompts

**Example Flow:**
1. User uploads childhood photo of family at beach
2. AI detects: 4 people, beach setting, vintage clothing (1970s), summer
3. System generates prompts:
   - "Tell me about this day at the beach. What do you remember?"
   - "Who are the people in this photo? Describe each person."
   - "What was the weather like? What could you smell and hear?"
   - "What happened before or after this photo was taken?"

#### Option 2: Text-First with Photo Enhancement

User writes memory → Uploads related photo → AI enriches description

**Example Flow:**
1. User writes: "My mother was a beautiful woman with kind eyes"
2. User uploads photo of mother
3. AI analyzes: Dark curly hair, warm smile, 1960s style dress, gentle expression
4. AI enhances prose: "My mother was a beautiful woman with dark curly hair that framed her face in soft waves. Her warm smile and gentle brown eyes had a way of making everyone feel seen and valued."

---

### Photo Analysis Capabilities

The AI vision system extracts:

#### Physical Details:
- Facial features, hair color/style, clothing, physical build
- Age approximation, expressions, body language

#### Environmental Context:
- Location type (indoor/outdoor, urban/rural)
- Time period indicators (clothing styles, cars, architecture)
- Weather, lighting, season

#### Emotional Tone:
- Facial expressions, group dynamics
- Formal vs casual setting
- Mood indicators

#### Composition Elements:
- Who's in frame, positioning, focus
- Background details, objects present
- Photo quality/era

---

### Photo-Enhanced Prompts

When a photo is uploaded, the system generates photo-specific prompts:

#### For People:
- "I can see [person] in this photo. Tell me about their personality—what made them special?"
- "What was [person's] voice like? How did they laugh?"
- "This photo shows [person] wearing [clothing]. Was this typical for them?"

#### For Places:
- "This looks like [location type]. What memories do you have of this place?"
- "I can see [specific details] in the background. Tell me more about that."
- "What was it like to be in this space? What did it feel like?"

#### For Events:
- "This appears to be [event type]. What was the occasion?"
- "Who took this photo? Why was it important to capture this moment?"
- "What happened right before or after this photo was taken?"

---

### Photo Metadata Structure

Extend `media_files` metadata:

```json
{
  "resolution": "3000x2000",
  "dpi": 300,
  "ai_analysis": {
    "people_detected": [
      {
        "position": "center",
        "estimated_age": "30-35",
        "gender": "female",
        "description": "Dark curly hair, warm smile, floral dress",
        "user_identified_as": "mother"
      }
    ],
    "setting": {
      "type": "outdoor",
      "location_type": "beach",
      "time_period": "1970s",
      "season": "summer",
      "weather": "sunny"
    },
    "objects": ["beach umbrella", "picnic basket", "vintage camera"],
    "mood": "joyful, relaxed",
    "quality": "vintage, slightly faded"
  },
  "user_context": {
    "caption": "Family beach day, summer 1975",
    "people_in_photo": ["Mom", "Dad", "Me", "Sister"],
    "location": "Cape Cod, Massachusetts",
    "memory_text": "This was our annual summer trip..."
  },
  "narrative_usage": {
    "chapters": ["childhood"],
    "placement": "full_page",
    "page_number": 23,
    "enhances_memory_fragments": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]
  }
}
```

---

### Photo-Driven Quality Enhancement

**Before Photo Analysis:**
> "My mother was a kind woman who always made me feel loved."

**After Photo Analysis + User Input:**
> "My mother had dark curly hair that she wore in soft waves around her face, and warm brown eyes that crinkled at the corners when she smiled—which was often. In this photo from our 1975 beach trip to Cape Cod, she's wearing her favorite floral sundress, the one with the yellow daisies. She's laughing at something my father said, her hand shading her eyes from the bright summer sun. That laugh—it was infectious, a sound that could fill a room and make everyone feel like they were in on the joke."

---

## Phase 5: The User Experience Flow (Calm + Guided)

### Phase 1: "Start at the Beginning"

Unlock **Origins** + **Childhood** first.

- One prompt at a time
- Short answers encouraged (200-500 words)
- Voice recording optional but guided (60–120 seconds)
- Photo upload encouraged: "Have a photo from this time? Upload it to help tell the story."
- Progress indicator: "2 of 8 memories captured in this section"

### Phase 2: "Build Momentum"

Once they've contributed enough "story atoms" (5-8 memories), unlock:
- Teen Years
- Early Adulthood

### Phase 3: "Branch Based on Life"

System offers personalized paths based on profile:
- Partnership track (if applicable)
- Parenthood track (if applicable)
- Career deep dive (if they had major careers)
- Adventures & travel (if they flagged it)

### Phase 4: "Synthesis Checkpoints"

After each life stage, the system produces:

1. **Chapter draft preview** (read-only, book-like prose with photos placed)
2. **2–3 gentle follow-ups:**
   - "One more specific moment would strengthen this chapter…"
   - "Would you like to add a photo here?"
   - "I noticed you mentioned [person]. Do you have a photo of them?"
3. **Completion confirmation:**
   - "This section feels complete. Ready to move to your teenage years?"

This enforces quality without a human editor.
